### Overview of My Submission

We build a platform to mint NFTs from achievements.
In this mvp we can use achievements from our steam account,
but we hope in the future to add many other providers :D

In order to achieve this we use appwirte as a backend for
the interaction between our frontend 
and our nodes connected to the cardano blockchain.

What inspired us to do this was the idea of having a centralized place to store our
of having a decentralized place to store our achievements,
badges, awards from different platforms and to make these achievements
be more than just a badge within the platforms where we get them.

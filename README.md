> Create NFTs from your achievements.

## Overview

BadgeAr is a place where you can transform your awards, trophies, and badges into a digital token (NFT).

When we say "achievements" we mean that you can connect your accounts and create NFTs from awards given to you by that community or provider. For example, you can add you Steam account and create a NFT from your Steam achievements. In other words, you can mint NFTs from your gaming sessions.

For this MVP, the only abailable provider is Steam, but we plan to add other kind of providers in the future. This could open the posibility to create NFTs from your achievements in other platforms / activities.

In order to achieve this, we use appwirte as a backend to manage
the interaction between our frontend and our nodes connected to the cardano blockchain.

What inspired us to do this was the idea of having **a decentralized place to store our achievements, badges, awards** from different platforms and to make these achievements be more than just a badge within the platforms where we get them.

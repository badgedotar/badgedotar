  # Badge Ar
  `With Badge.ar you can transform your gaming achievements into NFTs.`

  ### How does it works?

  - First, you create an account and sync it with steam.
  - Then, select the achievements that you want to mint.
  - Finally, pay the transaction using ADA (Cardano) and the NTFs will be minted and added to your wallet.
  
  We generate a new wallet for each account. The user can add ADA to that wallet and it will be used to pay for de transactions and hold the NFTs until the user decided to withdraw (pending feature).
  
  ### Vision
  
  The idea behind the project is to give the user the possibility to transform any kind of badge or award into an NFT.
  
  Steam is just an example of one provider. We could add more achievements providers so the user can transform other kinds of trophies and rewards into NFTs.
  
  For example, a brand could organize a marathon and give its participants an NFT using our platform.
  
  ### Future features
  
  - Withdraw functionality of NFTs.
  - More achievements providers.
